# Sir Horse

![Screenshot of a game.](/assets/example.png)

## About

A small, weird prototype made in Godot 4.  
You play as a horse that completes basic quests by moving items around and unlocking exits.

There’s no real story, no upgrades, no complexity — just a grid-based puzzle with a horse and some switches.

It started as a joke. Still kind of is.

⚠️ Prototype. Minimal gameplay. Might make you smile. Or quit.
