# Sir Horse

## Lore (seriously)

An evil wizard forgot to activate his magical security spells. A team of so-called heroes attacked his tower.  
Unfortunately, the heroes were complete idiots.

One of them, a mage, tried to cast a killing spell. It backfired. The evil wizard was turned into a horse and teleported far away.

Left behind, the wizard’s wand, now masterless, killed the heroes and unleashed a magical storm that devastated the land.

Now, as a horse, you must escape each area by solving puzzles and unlocking exits. Maybe you’ll find a way back. Maybe not.

## About

A small, weird prototype made in Godot 4.  
You play as a horse that completes basic quests by moving items around and unlocking exits.

There’s no real story... wait, actually, yes, there is — see above.  
No upgrades, no combat, just logic, blocks and awkward trotting.

⚠️ Prototype. Minimal gameplay. Might make you smile. Or uninstall Godot.

## Preview

No playable build yet.
